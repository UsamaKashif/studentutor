                    <li>your physical or electronic signature;</li>
                    <li>identification of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim to have been infringed;</li>

                <p>Please note that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), any misrepresentation of material fact in a written notification automatically subjects the complaining party to liability for any damages, costs and attorney’s fees incurred by us in connection with the written notification and allegation of copyright infringement.</p>
